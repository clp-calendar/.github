# SweetDate – A Headless Calendar

SweetDate, an open-source, headless calendar engine designed to support European values of openness, GDPR compliance, privacy, and interoperability.

 It offers a command-based interface for full calendar functionality — including events, availability, and recurring logic — while giving developers complete control over deployment and integration.

Unlike APIs or formats like iCalendar, SweetDate is a backend engine that’s ready to use, with client libraries to simplify implementation.

Built for developers, SaaS platforms, and infrastructure projects that value privacy, flexibility, and data ownership.
