# CLP – A Headless Calendar

CLP is a headless calendar backend designed for modern applications. It offers a command-based interface for full calendar functionality — including events, availability, and recurring logic — while giving developers complete control over deployment and integration.

Built for developers, SaaS platforms, and infrastructure projects that value privacy, flexibility, and data ownership.
